# Two different types of tests
# script - to run bash scripts or compile files and running anyother code that doesn't need to check outputs, will give results based on exit code.
# IO - to run IO tests.

# IO- io tests take an input and output parameters. you can pass all the inputs with input and required output with output var.
# script - can also take input parameter if required.
